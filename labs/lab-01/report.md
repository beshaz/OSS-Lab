### Smart Questions
One suggestion for how to answer questions in a helpful way is that if you are aware of a pre-existing answer to the same or a similar problem posed by someone else online that may have been either difficult to find or seemed unrelated, it would be helpful to include links to these answers as the questioner may find the discussion following the original question more helpful than the answers to their own question, depending on who answered each one.  Another suggestion for how to answer questions in a helpful way is that if the question is related to a certain program or feature, it is helpful to include either screenshots or links to other screenshots and tutorials as a part of your answer, as people often have more success solving their problems by following along with a visual media as opposed to just written directions.

### Free Culture
After reading chapter 3 of Free Culture, I learned that even when working on seemingly innocent software projects, you must be certain that your product is being used in a legal way, in addition to the frameworks and other third party software packages used to build the product.  While in Jesse's mind he likely thought he had done nothing wrong in simply being the creator of what was essentially a public file sharing service, part of the search engine's user base was using the search engine in a similar fashion to LimeWire was used prior to being shut down.  LimeWire was a popular piece of software used by many to download popular music for free that was uploaded by its users.  My family personally used this, and I still have an iPod Classic filled with this illegal music.  This service was pirating music and software for its users, and even if LimeWire's creators may not have intended for it to be used this way, the group essentially supported this behavior by continuing to update and improve their product.  While I don't think Jesse did anything illegally intentionally, it would have been wise to discourage this sort use of his search engine and potentially implement mechanisms to review certain files when being indexed and uploaded into the service.  The moral of Jesse's story is to make sure all the software you create is made using correctly licensed third party software and used for a legal purpose that does not unintentionally infringe upon copyrights or licenses.  In cases where it is uncertain if this is occurring, you should consult with a lawyer or other reliable sources to ensure you aren't in danger of a potential lawsuit.
