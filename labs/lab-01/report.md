### Smart Questions
One suggestion for how to answer questions in a helpful way is that if you are aware of a pre-existing answer to the same or a similar problem posed by someone else online that may have been either difficult to find or seemed unrelated, it would be helpful to include links to these answers as the questioner may find the discussion following the original question more helpful than the answers to their own question, depending on who answered each one.  Another suggestion for how to answer questions in a helpful way is that if the question is related to a certain program or feature, it is helpful to include either screenshots or links to other screenshots and tutorials as a part of your answer, as people often have more success solving their problems by following along with a visual media as opposed to just written directions.
